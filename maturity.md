# Maturity Assessment for Apache SDAP

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

More details can be found [here](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

## Status of this assessment

This assessment is still in progress.

## Maturity model assessment

Binary images are not provided as official Apache realease, though some are available through [Apache dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=apache%2Fsdap-).                                                             |

The guide is not (yet) publically available, but is provided to a future RM upon the start of the release cycle. |

| **CO40** | The community strives to be meritocratic and gives more rights and responsibilities to contributors who, over time, add value to the project.                                                                                                                                   | **YES** The community has elected 5 new PPMC members in 2022 and 2023.                                                                                                                               |
| **CO50** | The project documents how contributors can earn more rights such as commit access or decision power, and applies these principles consistently.                                                                                                                                 | **NOT YET** The community is discussing this now.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **CO60** | The community operates based on consensus of its members (see CS10) who have decision power. Dictators, benevolent or not, are not welcome in Apache projects.                                                                                                                  | **YES - For major changes** Major project decisions (releases, large PRs, PPMC additions) are made by community VOTE on dev@. Some smaller PRs are reviewed and approved by the PPMC through Github. |
| **CO70** | The project strives to answer user questions in a timely manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **YES** We have resources such as ASF Slack, our mailing lists, Jira, etc that users can use to ask questions of the community.

| **CS10** | The project maintains a public list of its contributors who have decision power. The project's PPMC (Project Management Committee) consists of those contributors.                                                        | **YES** The website has a list of [team and community members](https://sdap.apache.org/team): PPMC, mentors and additional collaborators (SDAP users who frequently provide helpful input), with names, emails and github links.                                                                                                 |
| **CS20** | Decisions require a consensus among PPMC members and are documented on the project's main communications channel. The PPMC takes community opinions into account, but the PPMC has the final word.                        | **YES** All decisions are made by votes on dev@sdap.apache.org, and with at least 3 +1 votes from PPMC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **CS30** | The project uses documented voting rules to build consensus when discussion is not sufficient.                                                                                                                            | **YES** The project uses the standard ASF voting rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **CS40** | In Apache projects, vetoes are only valid for code commits. The person exercising the veto must justify it with a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30.                                  | **YES** Apache SDAP community has not used the veto power yet except for code commits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **CS50** | All "important" discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the project's main communications channel. Offline, face-to-face or private discussions that affect the project are also documented on that channel. | **YES** All important discussions and conclusions are recorded in written form. The SDAP community hosts a monthly public meeting to discuss project issues and progress. Invites and reminders are posted to dev@ prior to the meetings, agendas are available through the ASF Confluence wiki, and minutes are posted to dev@. |
