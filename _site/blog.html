  <p>COAL was presented to attendees of the <a href="https://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov/events/2017-hyspiri-science-team-meeting">2017 HyspIRI Science and Applications Workshop</a> which took place at the California Institute of Technology, Beckman Institute Auditorium, 1200 E California Blvd Pasadena, CA 91125 from Oct 17th - 19th. COAL was presented alongside a huge variety of outstanding work in the area of Global Earth Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal Infrared Measurements.</p>

  <p>The workshop was focused on everything related to the NASA Decadal Survey Mission Concept named <a href="https://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov">HyspIRI</a>; Hyperspectral Infrared Imager. HyspIRI will study the world’s ecosystems and provide critical information on natural disasters such as volcanoes, wildfires and drought. HyspIRI will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. The mission will provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. The mission will also assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires.</p>

  <p>The HyspIRI mission includes two instruments mounted on a satellite in Low Earth Orbit. There is an imaging spectrometer measuring from the visible to short wave infrared (VSWIR: 380 nm - 2500 nm) in 10 nm contiguous bands and a multispectral imager measuring from 3 to 12 um in the mid and thermal infrared (TIR). The VSWIR and TIR instruments both have a spatial resolution of 60 m at nadir. The VSWIR will have a revisit of of 19 days and the TIR will have a revisit of 5 days. HyspIRI also includes an Intelligent Payload Module (IPM) which will enable direct broadcast of a subset of the data.</p>

  <p>The data from HyspIRI will be used for a wide variety of studies primarily in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem and Earth Surface and Interior focus areas. The mission was recommended in the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey requested by NASA, NOAA, and USGS.The mission is currently at the study stage and this website is being provided as a focal point for information on the mission and to keep the community informed on the mission activities.</p>

  <p>We intend to extend COAL to accomodate data from HyspIRI once it is available. In the meantime we look forward to continued work and collaborations with members of the Global Earth Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal Infrared Measurements community. The COAL poster presented at the HyspIRI Workshop can be downloaded from our <a href="./publications.html">publications page</a>.</p>

<p>Posted <b>2017-10-16</b> by <b>Lewis John McGibbney</b></p>
<div class="clearfix">

  <p>We we absolutely stoked to receive excellent news that the <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/?page=preview&pid=320">COAL Follow-On (COAL-FO) project proposal</a> was accepted by Oregon State Universities Senior Capstone program. This will enable us to continue critical work into COAL software development, research and utilization of the XSEDE Startup resources we have available.</p>

  <p>We are very happy to welcome Kenneth Bertino Thompson and Bryce Egley, our new Senior Computer Scientists from OSU's College for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to the COAL team. The 2017-2018 project is the successor project to the 2016-2017 COAL project. COAL initially aimed to deliver a suite of algorithms to identify, classify, characterize, and quantify (by reporting a number of key metrics) the direct and indirect impacts of mining operations and related destructive surface mining activities across the continental U.S (and further afield). COAL successfully delivered a Python library for processing hyperspectral imagery from remote sensing devices such as the Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and a Science Data System for running COAL pipelines. COAL-FO will utilize recent funding obtained from a recently awarded NSF-funded XSEDE high performance computing (HPC) grant to further improve, validate and document COAL algorithms, execution runtime performance and geospatial output results.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Taylor, Heidi, and Xiaomei from <a href="/team">the COAL team</a> presented the poster and demo at the Undergraduate Engineering Expo 2017 on Friday, May 19<sup>th</sup> 2017. Expo featured more than 200 projects by more than 600 undergraduate students from the College of Engineering at Oregon State University. COAL was promoted by Expo media as an example of computer science excellence. The COAL team shared its methodology and findings with members of the academic community, representatives from industry, and the general public and enjoyed in-depth conversations about remote sensing, environmental science, and software development.</p>

  <p>COAL was selected for one of four industry <a href="http://expo.engr.oregonstate.edu/awards" class="external">awards</a> presented during Expo, the CH2M Multidisciplinary Collaboration Award. The COAL team spoke with CH2M representatives who were interested in its work with the scientific and Free Software communities and the possible applications of its remote sensing techniques to environmental remediation efforts. After several rounds of interviews with the judges, COAL was chosen based on the following criteria:
</p>

  <blockquote>Complex projects rarely exist within a single technical field. Collaboration between technical specialists is necessary to meet client needs and design criteria. Quality begins with a defined design development process. CH2M will award the Multidisciplinary Collaboration Award to a project team that clearly demonstrates proactive planning and collaboration with others at key points throughout project execution. The impact of the collaboration should be to produce an innovative final product which returns high value to the project sponsor/client or to overcome unique technical challenges. The selected team shall be prepared to describe the design process leading up to the final product, and the lessons learned along the way.</blockquote>

  <p>The award was presented during the ceremony at the end of Expo. The COAL team was honored to be recognized by OSU and CH2M.</p>

  <p>The presentation at Expo provided opportunities to promote the COAL project and communicate its methodology and findings to the public. The interest from members of the community demonstrated that remote sensing is an increasingly important technique for environmental science. The COAL team is pleased with a successful conclusion to its senior capstone collaboration between OSU and JPL.</p>

<a href="/2017/04/30/gdal-envi-rotation-bug-fix.html"><h2>GDAL ENVI Rotation Bug Fix</h2></a>
<p>Posted <b>2017-04-30</b> by <b>Taylor Alexander Brown</b></p>
<p>COAL is a library for processing imaging spectrometer data from <a href="https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/" class="external">AVIRIS</a> and <a href="https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/" class="external">AVIRIS-NG</a>. The multiband raster imagery is provided in <a href="http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/enviheaderfiles.html" class="external">ENVI</a> format. COAL uses the <a href="http://gdal.org/" class="external">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)</a> and the Free and Open Source geographic information system <a href="http://qgis.org/en/site/" class="external">QGIS</a> to process imagery and combine it with geographic data for analysis. Due to a bug in GDAL, rotation information in ENVI files was not handled and the images were not imported correctly. This post describes a bug fix which was developed for COAL and contributed back to GDAL.</p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption"><b>Figure 2:</b> Correctly rotated flightline.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

<p>The rotation issue was first discussed <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/coal-capstone/nXhRb1fA7lg/aW8efhNUAgAJ" class="external">on our mailing list</a> after loading the imagery into GIS applications. The same behavior was observed in QGIS, GRASS, and ArcMap, all of which use the underlying GDAL library. To help solve the problem, a <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/229952/rotate-envi-hyperspectral-imagery-with-gdal" class="external">question</a> was posted to the GIS StackExchange describing the issue and requesting assistance. The proposed answer did not work, suggesting it was due to a <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1778" class="external">bug</a> in the ENVI driver of the GDAL library itself.</p>

<p>It was found that the ENVI rotation parameter, which is not documented in the header file format, was ignored by GDAL when reading the geographic transformation information. As a result, images were imported incorrectly by all software using GDAL, including the Python interface, command-line utilities, and GIS applications. The problem affected the GDAL source file <code>gdal/frmts/raw/envidataset.cpp</code>. Editing this file with the values suggested by the StackExchange answer solved the issue, allowing images to be rotated correctly.</p>

<p>The solution was shared <a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2017-February/046127.html" class="external">on the GDAL mailing list</a> where it received feedback from the GDAL developers. After addressing the changes requested by the maintainers, a <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/197" class="external">pull request</a> was submitted. The maintainer added write support to <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/37506" class="external">the patch</a> and merged it into the latest version of the library scheduled for release on 2017-05-01 as part of GDAL <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/milestone/2.2.0" class="external">2.2.0</a>.

<p>The resolution of this bug facilitated continued progress in COAL for processing and visualizing georeferenced raster imagery. It also provided experience contributing to another Free and Open Source Software library. Once the latest version of GDAL is released, QGIS and other applications will have enhanced capabilities for reading and writing ENVI files from AVIRIS, AVIRIS-NG, and other remote-sensing devices.</p>
